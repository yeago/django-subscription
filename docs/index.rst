   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Installation
------------

There are two possible installations:

- the "bare" installation which is currently described in the README
- the "example" installation from yourlabs which is described here, in unit
  tests and docstrings. This will get you started much faster but might be
  harder to customize than coding everything from scratch ...

Indices and tables
